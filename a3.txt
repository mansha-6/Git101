Q3 - What is Git? What are it's advantages over other types of version control
Ans - Git is a distributed version control system (DVCS) designed to track changes in files, especially in source code during software development. 
Created by Linus Torvalds in 2005, Git is free and open-source, and it's one of the most widely used tools for version control today.

In Git, every developer has a full copy of the repository, including its entire history. 
Changes can be made locally and later synchronized with other copies of the repository through pushing and pulling changes.

Key Features of Git
Distributed System: Each developer has a complete local copy of the repository.
Efficient Branching and Merging: Developers can create, manage, and merge branches seamlessly.
Speed: Git is designed to be very fast for operations like branching, merging, and history lookup.
Data Integrity: Ensures the integrity of your data using cryptographic hashing (SHA-1).
Lightweight: Git repositories are highly efficient in storage and speed.
Offline Capabilities: Most operations can be performed without a networkÂ connection.
